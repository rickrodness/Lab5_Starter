1. No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application if it involves the complete process of writing and sending a message to another user. This is because testing this feature likely involves multiple components and interactions, such as UI, network communication, and database operations.
2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. This feature is a good candidate for unit testing because it involves an isolated piece of functionality, checking the length of a message. It can be easily tested to ensure that it correctly prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
